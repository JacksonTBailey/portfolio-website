            <p>renaisance man,  philomath, linguist. 
From space exploration to programming, and everything in between, I've always held a strong affinity for learning. Much like a Firebender can draw upon techniques from the Water Tribe and incorperate them within his bending, I draw upon knowledge that I've learned from vastly different disciplines and use it to create beautiful websites.
